# Supplementary

## Welcome to the Supplementary folder.
This section provides practical, real-world support for applying the SDLC in modern delivery environments across the Department.

These materials are not formal SDLC requirements, nor do they replace the core SDLC Tracks, Stages, Processes or Controls. Instead, they offer helpful context, bridging information, examples, and workarounds to support teams operating in Agile, Iterative, Product, DevOps and CI/CD models alongside existing governance expectations.

Purpose of This Folder
- This folder exists to support teams by providing:
- Practical hints and tips for applying the SDLC day-to-day
- Bridging guidance to help teams operate in both traditional and iterative models
- Explanations and examples where official SDLC documentation is intentionally high-level
- Workarounds and gap-fillers for areas where the SDLC is evolving
- Real-world patterns and good practice drawn from delivery teams across the organisation
- Supplementary FAQs that clarify common points of confusion
- Lightweight approaches to governance, evidence and controls (e.g. CT Tickets, iterative risk)
- Guidance for automation (pipelines, versioning, DevOps workflows)

This content is designed to assist teams, not constrain them.
