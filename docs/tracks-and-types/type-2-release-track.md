# Type 2 Release Track

## Overview

The Type 2 Release Track applies to medium-sized releases that vary in classification depending on the business area. For example:

* In Information & Technologies and Human Resources branches, Type 2 releases correspond to **Minor releases**.
* In Finance, they may map to **Major** or **Significant releases**, depending on internal scope type mappings.

These release types typically include enhancements, moderate changes, or feature additions that do not require the full SDLC from ideation.


## Stages Covered

Type 2 releases begin at the **Requirements** stage and continue through to **Maintenance**.
Accordingly, the artefacts, approvals, and controls defined for all included stages apply:

* Requirements
* Analysis and Design
* Implementation
* Test
* Deployment
* Maintenance

This reflects that Type 2 releases do not require early lifecycle stages (Needs or Concept), as the system already exists and stakeholder problem-framing has previously been undertaken.


## Special Considerations

* Type 2 releases still require appropriate risk assessment and governance oversight.
* Release Scope Type and Release Risk Impact Level must be determined through the Release Planning and Scope Type Determination process.
* Although less rigorous than Type 1 releases, Type 2 work may still involve complex change, integration, or stakeholder engagement and therefore must follow all required artefacts and controls within their covered stages.
