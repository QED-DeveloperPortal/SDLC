# Maintenance Stage

## Overview

The Maintenance Stage begins when the system enters operational use and requires ongoing maintenance, logistics, and support services.
This stage continues until the system is ultimately retired and support is terminated.

The focus of this stage is to:

* support day-to-day operation of the system
* monitor and maintain system capability
* address anomalies, deficiencies, and failures
* manage system evolution through new versions or configurations

Maintenance also includes monitoring the support system itself and addressing failures within the support processes.



## Purpose

To provide maintenance, logistics, and support services that ensure the system continues to operate effectively throughout its life.



## Artefacts

| Artefact                | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System Release Schedule | A list describing bug fixes, changes, modifications, or new features planned for future releases. |



## Controls

* All issues reported during the support process must be recorded and documented with sufficient detail to allow replication.



## Stage Processes



### Support Process

#### Purpose

To sustain the capability of the system to provide its intended services.
This involves monitoring system performance, recording incidents, taking corrective or preventive action, and confirming restored capability.

Aligned with the **ISO 15288 Maintenance Process**.

#### Outcomes

* Maintenance constraints affecting requirements, architecture, or design are identified.
* Replacement, repaired, or revised system elements are made available.
* The need for corrective, adaptive, or perfective changes is reported.
* Failure and lifetime data, including associated costs, is collected.



### Release Planning and Scope Type Determination Process

#### Purpose

To bundle support and change requests into a planned release, define the release scope, and determine the appropriate release scope type.

This ensures that each planned release is correctly classified (Type 1, 2, or 3) and that the right SDLC stages and artefacts are applied.

#### Notes

* A first release of a new system is always a Type 1 release.
* If new requirements introduce changes to business processes (especially involving external agencies), teams are encouraged to classify the release as Type 1 to maintain full traceability—even if small in size.
* Release Risk and Scope Type Determination is available via the Release Wizard: *[http://ReleaseWizard.det.qld.gov.au](http://ReleaseWizard.det.qld.gov.au)*
* This process aligns with Decision Management and Project Planning Processes in ISO 15288.

#### Outcomes

* Releases, their scope, and objectives are identified.
* Roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities are defined.
* Resources required for the release are requested and committed.
* Release delivery plans are developed.
* Scope type classification is determined for the release and associated development activity.
* The classification determines which SDLC stages and artefacts apply.
* Appropriate rigour is applied based on release risk.

#### Type 1 Release Threshold

Releases estimated at **30 people-months or more** are proposed to be classified as **Type 1** (major releases).
This threshold ensures that large, complex work always goes through the full SDLC.
