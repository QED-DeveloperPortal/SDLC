# Needs stage

## Overview
The **Needs Stage** begins when a new idea or requirement for a system improvement is identified.
This stage assesses whether a business process could be enhanced through the application of information technology.

During this stage, an **Idea Definition Document (or Problem/Need Statement)** is created, outlining the business opportunity, solution concept, feasibility, and criticality of the proposed system.

> **Note:** Traceability back to the approved **Idea Definition** is an important outcome of this stage.
> Development teams—especially under **Type 1 Release Tracks**—are encouraged to complete this stage whenever business traceability and early stakeholder alignment would add value, regardless of release size or scope.


## Purpose
To assess new business opportunities and develop preliminary, high-level requirements for the proposed system or enhancement.

| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Idea Definition Document / Problem or Need Statement** | Summarises the business opportunity, high-level solution idea, possible options, feasibility, and identified stakeholders. |



## Controls

| **Control Requirement**                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The **Idea Definition Document** must be approved by all relevant stakeholders before the stage can be considered fulfilled.                                         |
| Custodians of any related or enabling systems must provide their **support or endorsement** of the idea.                                                             |
| A **feasibility assessment** should be conducted at the solution architecture level to confirm whether the idea is implementable as an enhancement or new component. |
| The proposal’s **alignment to Enterprise Architecture (EA)** must be reviewed and verified by the **Enterprise Architecture Board**.                                 |
| For releases with **High Risk**, the Idea Definition Document must be **signed off by all stakeholder groups**, including external agencies where applicable.        |
| For **High Risk** or **strategic releases**, executive-level approval of the Idea Definition Document is required.                                                   |



## Stage Process

### High-Level Idea Definition Process

#### Purpose

Defines the business or mission problem or opportunity, characterises the potential solution space, and determines the class of solutions that could address the opportunity.
This process is aligned with the **Business or Mission Analysis Process** defined in *ISO 15288:2015*.

> **Note:**
> Stakeholders may include users, operators, developers, producers, maintainers, external organisations, regulatory bodies, or other interested parties.
> External stakeholder engagement is critical where systems interact with external agencies or affect public services.


#### Outcomes

* Stakeholders and their classes are identified.
* The problem or opportunity space is defined.
* The potential solution space is characterised.
* Preliminary operational concepts are defined.
* Candidate alternative solutions are identified and analysed.
* Preferred alternative solution class(es) are selected.
* Enabling systems or services required for analysis are available.
* Traceability is established between business problems, opportunities, and preferred solutions.
* Levels of rigour applied are proportional to the assessed release risk.

| **Idea Definition Document / Problem or Need Statement** | Records the overview of the business opportunity, high-level solution idea, available options, and stakeholders identified. |



## Modernisation notes

* In Agile or Product models, this stage may map to an **Ideation Workshop**, **Lean Canvas**, or **Problem Statement** activity.
* Idea Definition can be captured in backlog tools (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) as **“Epic Proposals”** for traceability.
* Early-stage alignment with **EA principles** and **Data Classification** helps prevent rework later in design and build.
* Approval and traceability can be supported through **digital sign-off workflows**, **repository metadata**, or **workflow automation**.
