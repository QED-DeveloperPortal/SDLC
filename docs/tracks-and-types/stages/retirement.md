# Retirement Stage

## Overview

During the Retirement Stage, the system is withdrawn from normal service.
This includes archiving the system, decommissioning components, and providing limited transitional support to users for an agreed period.



## Purpose

To ensure the system is properly and safely disposed of, with appropriate provisions in place to transition to a non-operational state.
This includes meeting organisational, legal, safety, environmental, and security requirements.

## Stage Processes



### Disposal Process

#### Purpose

To end the existence of the system or system elements for their intended use, and to correctly handle all replaced or retired components.
This includes attending to all critical disposal needs such as organisational policy requirements, environmental responsibilities, legal constraints, safety considerations, and security obligations.

Aligned with the **ISO 15288 Disposal Process**.

#### Notes

* Disposal activities may occur at multiple points in the SDLC.
* Examples include disposing of prototypes during early stages or decommissioning obsolete elements during evolution of a system.

#### Outcomes

* Disposal constraints are provided as inputs to requirements, architecture, design, and implementation.
* Required enabling systems or services for disposal are available.
* System elements or waste products are destroyed, stored, reclaimed, or recycled in accordance with safety and security requirements.
* The environment is restored to its original or an agreed state.
* Disposal actions and analysis are recorded and retained.
