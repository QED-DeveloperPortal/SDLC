# Concept stage

## Overview
The **Concept Stage** begins when a recognised need or idea transitions into structured exploration and planning.
This stage formalises the initial recognition of a requirement for a new system-of-interest or modification to an existing one.
It is primarily a **fact-finding and framing period**, where the idea evolves into a potential **project or work package**.


## Purpose
To transition a **validated need or idea** into a formally scoped **project** or **work package** after required checks and governance controls are applied.


## Artefacts

| **Artefact**                                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operational Concept**                                            | Optional artefact that outlines a high-level roadmap for the solution. For long-lived systems (e.g. *OneSchool*), this artefact may already exist and should be maintained as modules or components are added. |
| **Terms of Reference for Project or Application Governance Board** | Defines the purpose and structure of a project or board, including sponsor commitments, governance responsibilities, and team accountabilities.                                                                |
| **Project Brief**                                                  | Summarises the results of projectisation and planning, defining scope, objectives, and resource expectations.                                                                                                  |
| **Preliminary Business Requirements Specification**                | Captures early-stage business requirements and forms the basis for subsequent detailed analysis.                                                                                                               |


## Controls

| **Control Requirement**                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All artefacts produced during this stage must be approved by relevant stakeholders before the stage can be considered complete. |
| For development activities assessed as **High Risk**, the **Project Brief** must be signed off at **executive level**.          |


## Stage Processes

### Preliminary Business Requirements Compilation Process

#### Purpose

Defines the **stakeholder and system requirements** needed to deliver the desired services in a defined environment.
This process transforms user and stakeholder needs into a common, validated set of **preliminary requirements** that guide future design and validation activities.
Aligned with the **Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process** in *ISO 15288:2015*.

#### Outcomes

* Required characteristics and context of use are defined.
* Constraints on the system are identified.
* Stakeholder needs are gathered, prioritised, and expressed as requirements.
* Critical performance measures are defined.
* Stakeholder agreement is achieved confirming that needs and expectations are adequately represented.
* Traceability between stakeholder requirements, needs, and source stakeholders is established.
* Levels of rigour are applied proportionally to the assessed release risk.

#### Process Artefacts

| **Artefact**                                        | **Description**                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preliminary Business Requirements Specification** | Records the initial, high-level business and stakeholder requirements. |



### Projectisation and Planning Process

#### Purpose

Scopes the identified work into a **project or work package** and coordinates effective and practical plans.
This process determines management and technical scope, defines artefacts, establishes schedules, resources, and success criteria for project execution.
Aligned with the **Project Planning Process** in *ISO 15288:2015*.

> **Note:**
> Planning is an ongoing practice. Iterative or Agile teams should revisit and refine plans regularly.
> The **Iteration Planning Process** (in the *Analysis and Design Stage*) ensures planning continues beyond projectisation for Type 2 and Type 3 releases.

#### Outcomes

* Scope of work is defined and documented.
* Objectives and plans are established.
* Roles, responsibilities, and authorities are defined.
* Required resources and services are formally requested and committed.
* Plans for execution are activated.
* Rigour and documentation depth scale with assessed release risk.

#### Process Artefacts

| **Artefact**                                                       | **Description**                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operational Concept**                                            | Optional artefact describing a high-level roadmap for the solution (maintained for long-life systems such as *OneSchool*). |
| **Terms of Reference for Project or Application Governance Board** | Defines purpose, structure, and commitments between sponsors and delivery teams.                                           |
| **Project Brief**                                                  | Captures the agreed projectisation outcome including objectives, governance, and scope.                                    |



## Modernisation notes

* In Agile or Product models, this stage may map to **Epic Scoping**, **Product Vision Definition**, or **Initiative Briefing** activities.
* Artefacts such as the Project Brief and ToR can be maintained as **digital templates** in repositories for traceable governance.
* Early planning and preliminary requirements can be represented as **roadmaps**, **initiative canvases**, or **feature charters**.
* Approval workflows can be automated using digital sign-off processes or integrated **governance pipelines**.
* Long-term operational concepts may be supported by **EA roadmaps** or **living architecture documentation** tools.
