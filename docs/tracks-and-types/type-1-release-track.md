# Type 1 Release Track

## Overview

The Type 1 Release Track applies to the largest and most significant releases.
Depending on the business area, Type 1 releases may correspond to:

* **Major Releases** (e.g., Information & Technologies, Human Resources)
* **Projects** (e.g., Finance Branch)

Release scope mappings are defined in the internal scope mapping table for each organisational area.

Type 1 releases are substantial in scope, require full governance oversight, and must traverse **all SDLC stages**, from Needs through to Maintenance.


## Stages Covered

Type 1 releases include every SDLC stage:

* Needs
* Concept
* Requirements
* Analysis and Design
* Implementation
* Test
* Deployment
* Maintenance

This means all artefacts, approvals, controls, and decision points defined across these stages apply.


## Special Requirements

For Type 1 releases:

* The **Transition Process** in the Deployment Stage is mandatory.
* The **Validation Process** is also mandatory and ensures:

  * the system achieves its intended business outcomes
  * benefits and value assumptions are realized in practice
  * the solution is operable and effective in its real environment

These activities ensure that a major or project-level release not only deploys successfully but also delivers the expected organisational benefits.
