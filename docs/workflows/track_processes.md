# SDLC Track Processes
As illustrated in the SDLC conceptual model (Figure 6), depending on the scope type of the release, different stages of the SDLC are traversed and therefore, different types of artefacts and controls will be applicable. However, there are processes that should be performed irrespective of the size of development activity and/or release. These processes are those that are carried out per development activity.
