## Artefact and Document Versioning

### **Statement**

All SDLC artefacts and documents must be versioned in accordance to system/solution release version numbers for clarity, transparency and traceability purposes while each release can have its own independent documents based on the discretion of the development teams.

### **Rationale**

Release managers, change managers and other governance bodies may use such commonality as a criterion that illustrates the artefacts have been updated as required. It also helps establish traceability for forensic purposes.

### **Implications**

In case tools are used instead of documents, limitations may be faced depending on whether or not such tools can provide such identification/versioning mechanisms.
