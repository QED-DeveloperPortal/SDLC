## Release Acceptability and Readiness

### **Statement**

Before a release is considered acceptable and ready, it must fulfil all the “Release Acceptability Criteria and Quality Metrics” associated with its risk impact level.

### **Rationale**

For each possible release risk impact level, there should be a set of acceptability criteria to assess extrinsic qualities of the release (e.g. sign-offs and board approvals) and quality metrics to assess the intrinsic qualities of the release (e.g. regression test coverage). These concepts form a mechanism of mandating different levels of rigor to each release depending on its associated risk.

### **Implications**

The implementation and calculation of some quantitative metrics (e.g. functional coverage, functional correctness, and manual functional test coverage) may not be supported by default in most of Application Life Cycle Management Tools (e.g. Team Foundation Server) and may require extra manual work and integration.
