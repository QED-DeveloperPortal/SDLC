## Risk Level in Iterative Development

### **Statement**

The risk level can change in iterative development where changes are introduced incrementally and such changes have to be managed.

### **Rationale**

The risk level is a factor that defines the rigor and changes many of the SDLC workflows. Even though “Risk Assessment Process” should be performed at the beginning of a development activity, however, such risks must be re-assessed in each iteration to ensure minor incremental changes and their impacts are managed properly.

### **Implications**

The rigor being applied to the documentation may change during iterative development work as a consequence of the risk level getting changed which may require extra time or resources. Project managers and owners should be aware of such implications and update their schedules accordingly or alternatively, leave such changes for future releases.
