# Freedom in Tailoring the SDLC Artefacts

### **Statement**

As long as the outcomes of each SDLC process are achieved, the development teams are free to define their own artefact templates or use the tools that support achieving the outcomes without physical documentation.

### **Rationale**

As discussed in “Conformance to Standards”, DET SDLC Process Model claims conformance to ISO 15288:2015 [1] at outcomes level which requires the process outcomes to be achieved in full.

### **Implications**

The achievement of the process outcomes is a mandatory requirement and the ultimate true/false detector. A good balance between agility and governance can be achieved but not at the cost of lack of governance or documentation. The development teams should be aware that the process outcomes also provide the traceability that could be of great value, should the need arises.
