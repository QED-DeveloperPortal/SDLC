## Risk Level in Release Bundles

### **Statement**

The highest risk level included in a release bundle applies to the whole release bundle.

### **Rationale**

The risk level is a factor that defines the rigor and changes many of the SDLC workflows. It is acknowledged that bundling releases for different purposes (e.g. calendar restrictions and timing alignment) is a common practice and the SDLC does not discourage release bundling, however, such bundling should be performed for releases that have the same level of risk. It would be sensible to manage an individual high-risk release on its own without being bundled with other high-risk releases for consistency, transparency and traceability purposes.

### **Implications**

Extra time or resources may be required to support the isolation between releases of different risk levels.
