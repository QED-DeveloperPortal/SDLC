## Information Classification Changes in Iterative Development

### **Statement**

The information classification of data entities involved in iterative development may change and has to be re-assessed where changes are introduced incrementally.

### **Rationale**

Even though “Preliminary Information Classification Process” should be performed at the beginning of a development activity, however, such classifications must be re-assessed in each iteration, if the data models are changed, to ensure minor incremental changes and their impacts are managed properly.

### **Implications**

The project managers and owners should be aware that if information classification re-assessment becomes necessary, it may require extra time or resources and this can affect project delivery and schedules.
