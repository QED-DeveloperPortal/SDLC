#	The Unified Process
In a sense, DET’s SDLC process model could be viewed as a core Unified Process model surrounded by sequential Idea Projectization and Deployment/Maintenance milestones with a stronger emphasis on checkpoints and governance. 
The Deployment discipline of the Unified Process could be interpreted as equivalent to the “Pre-Verification Deployment Process” (section ‎7.9.5.1) in DET SDLC process model and therefore, early iterations in DET SDLC process model could be mapped to the iterations of the Inception phase in the Unified Process while the later iterations could be mapped to iterations of the transition phase of the Unified Process, as illustrated in Figure 25. 
In a way, the “phases” in the Unified Process (i.e. Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition) could be considered as “titles” given to “periods of time” with different levels of  focus and emphasis on different development “disciplines”. In DET SDLC process model, however, the checkpoints and milestones within each iteration have been given a higher weight for governance purposes.
