# Methodologies
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle or sometimes System Development Life Cycle models, and these are a variety of processes of design, development and testing that are used in the industry today. While there’s no best or standout when it comes to SDLC methodologies, so it’s essential to be across the most common models that can be applied to projects as companies are sure to have unique or specific software testing or SDLC process in place for their software development team.


### Agile / Scrum
An iterative, team-centred delivery method that focuses on short cycles, continual feedback, and delivering working increments of value.

### DevOps
A culture and practice combining development and operations to enable continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and rapid, reliable releases.

### Iterative
A cyclical delivery approach where solutions evolve through repeated cycles of planning, building, testing, and refinement.

### Lean
A value-driven methodology that emphasises reducing waste, improving flow, and delivering only what is needed at the right time.

### POM / Product Operating Model
A product-centred organisational approach that focuses on continuous value delivery, long-lived teams, user outcomes, and lifecycle accountability.

### Spiral
A risk-driven model that combines iterative development with structured phases, revisiting requirements and design in successive “spirals.”

### Unified Process / Unified Model (UML)
A disciplined, architecture-centric, use-case–driven development approach that progresses through iterative phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition) using UML to model and validate system behaviour.

### V-Model
A sequential method where each development phase has a corresponding validation/testing phase, emphasising traceability and upfront planning.

### Waterfall
A linear, phase-based development model where progress flows in sequence (requirements → design → development → testing → deployment).
