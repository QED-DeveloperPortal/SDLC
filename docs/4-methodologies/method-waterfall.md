# Waterfall-Based Methods
The methods that are based on the waterfall model (e.g. Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM)) are very easy fit the SDLC process model in single-iteration scenarios due to their sequential structure that starts with the requirements stage and ends with the verification (testing) stage.
DET’s SDLC process model is release/risk centric and that’s why the maintenance stage has been distributed in the overall life cycle through returning to the previous stages. The way DET’s SDLC has been formulated is aligned with making sure there is a singular governance model over the lifetime of the whole solution, including the maintenance/support period which includes the later releases of the solution/system and that’s why the maintenance stage does not include a micro life cycle model in relation to maintenance and minor releases.
Figure 24 illustrates the alignment of the waterfall model with DET’s SDLC process model in a single-iteration setup.
