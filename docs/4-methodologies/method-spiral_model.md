# Spiral Model
In DET’s SDLC process model, similar steps like the 2nd step in the Spiral Model (Identity and Resolve Risks) is carried out through the “SDLC Track Processes” as well as “System Analysis Process”.  In DET’s SDLC process model, similar steps like the 3rd step in the Spiral Model (Development and Test) are carried out through different iterations as illustrated in Figure 27.
Obviously, planning the next iteration and determining objectives are the practices that team leaders and/or project managers go through in the “Analysis and Design Stage” through the “Iteration Planning Process”.
