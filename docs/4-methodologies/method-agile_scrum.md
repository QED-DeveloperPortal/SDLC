# Agile / Scrum
Scrum has been traditionally a popular systems development method in DET and it can well fit within the new SDLC process model.
Traditionally, the product backlog is compiled once the requirements become known and during early analysis, through **“System Requirements Refinement Iterations”**, the backlog grows until the development starts for the first time. During each sprint, a number of items are planned and chosen for implementation via the **“Iteration Planning Process”**. Once the product reaches a level of maturity and the business has the chance to perform tests, the product backlog may be updated with new requirements through **“System Requirements Stabilization Iterations”**.  And finally, through **“Product Stabilization Iterations”**, issues and bugs may be added to the Sprint and/or Product Backlog, as illustrated in Figure 26.
