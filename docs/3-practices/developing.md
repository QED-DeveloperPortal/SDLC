## Developing
*Bringing ideas to life through working, testable, maintainable software.*
* Turns validated concepts into functional digital solutions
* Embraces iteration, pairing, review, and continuous improvement
* Balances speed with sustainability—building for now **and** later
* Encourages team collaboration, not solo coding
* Makes delivery smooth by integrating testing, documentation, and deployment readiness into the work


### Desired outcomes vs  Anti-patterns
*Desired outcomes:*
* Clean, maintainable, and secure code
* Working software delivered in small, testable increments
* Peer-reviewed, version-controlled work with traceability
* Automated tests integrated into the development workflow
* Shared ownership and visibility across the team

*Anti-patterns:*
* “Code complete” mentality with no thought for integration, testing, or release
* Handover-based dev work (e.g. "the devs will build this and throw it over the wall")
* Over-engineering or building for imagined future needs
* No documentation, no review, no tests
* Isolated developers with unclear context or purpose


### When we do it
* As early as possible after defining the scope of a small, testable increment
* In short loops—build, test, integrate, repeat
* When prototypes or validated concepts are ready to evolve
* Continuously, as part of CI/CD and Agile delivery models
* During spikes to explore technical feasibility or patterns


### Tools & Techniques
* Version control (e.g. Git) and branching strategies (e.g. trunk-based, feature branching)
* Peer programming or mob programming
* Pull requests and code review practices
* Test-driven development (TDD) and behaviour-driven development (BDD)
* Static code analysis, linters, and style guides
* Developer documentation and README hygiene
* Feature toggles and integration hooks
* Dev containers, local dev environments, and mock APIs
* DevOps automation and pre-deployment validation tools


### Practice in Action
**“During development of a new feature, the team committed to writing only what could be peer reviewed and tested in a single day. They paired up for complex logic, used feature toggles to keep incomplete work out of production, and integrated unit tests into their pull requests. This allowed them to merge confidently, release frequently, and avoid a long, risky QA backlog.”**
