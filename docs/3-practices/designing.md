# Designing
*Exploring and shaping possible solutions through rapid, testable ideas.*
* Makes thinking visible — so we can test it, challenge it, and improve it
* Allows us to experiment without the cost of building too early
* Encourages fast, flexible collaboration across disciplines
* Supports usability, accessibility, and clear communication
* Helps validate direction — then **evolve or discard** as needed


###  Desired outcomes vs  Anti-patterns
*Desired outcomes:*
* Shared understanding of how users might interact with a solution
* Clickable or testable prototypes grounded in real user needs
* Lightweight artefacts that help guide, not dictate, development
* Opportunities for teams and users to shape design direction
* Confident decisions on what to build — or what *not* to

*Anti-patterns:*
* Designs treated as final specs, not exploratory artefacts
* Overdesigned visuals that assume correctness before testing
* “Big reveal” designs created in isolation
* Treating design as ownership of a single role or team
* Clinging to unvalidated concepts because they “look done”


### When we do it
* After discovery and early definition work
* Before development starts—**or in parallel with it**
* When we need to explore multiple options or approaches
* As a lightweight way to reduce risk and gather feedback
* When introducing new flows, content, or experiences


### Tools & Techniques
* Clickable, disposable prototypes (Figma, XD, InVision)
* Interactive mockups that simulate key flows
* Co-design and sketching workshops
* Design sprints and spike activities
* Usability tests with rough prototypes
* Storyboards, task flows, or experience maps
* Wireframes annotated with user goals—not specs
* Content-first or plain language design
* Accessibility-by-design checklists


### Practice in Action
**“When planning a new onboarding feature, the team ran a short design spike. They mocked up two rough prototypes in Figma and tested both with actual users. One was discarded completely. The other evolved through feedback into a working design the devs could easily build—without needing final artwork or pixel-perfect alignment.”**
