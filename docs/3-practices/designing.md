# Designing

*Exploring, shaping, and validating ideas before we build.*

* Helps teams visualise and test ideas early, before costly development
* Improves usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction
* Encourages co-creation across disciplines (not just “design team” work)
* Reduces delivery risk by catching issues early
* Turns assumptions into testable artefacts


###  Desired outcomes vs  Anti-patterns

** Desired outcomes:**

* Clear, user-centred interface and workflow concepts
* Validated prototypes or mockups that reduce rework
* Consistent, accessible, and inclusive design patterns
* Team and stakeholder alignment on the intended experience
* Design decisions grounded in user research and constraints

** Anti-patterns:**

* Treating design as a handoff or solo activity
* “Pixel-perfect” designs created without user input
* Over-investing in design before validating the problem
* Designs that focus on aesthetics over usability
* Stakeholders dictating UI without context or evidence


###  When we do it

* After defining user needs and success outcomes
* Before or during early development (iteratively)
* When planning new features or flows
* To test multiple approaches to a problem
* When usability, accessibility, or clarity are at risk


### Tools & Techniques

* Wireframes, mockups, and clickable prototypes
* Design systems and component libraries
* Accessibility audits and inclusive design checks
* Co-design workshops with users and stakeholders
* Usability testing (in-person or remote)
* Journey maps, storyboards, and task flows
* Figma, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, or similar tools
* “Design spikes” for high-risk or unknown features
* UX writing, content design, and plain language testing


### 💬 Practice in Action

**“Ahead of a major new release, the team created clickable prototypes in Figma and invited five representative users for remote testing. One critical insight: users were missing a key feature because of how it was labelled. The team adjusted the layout and terminology, improving both usability and task completion—without writing a single line of code.”**
