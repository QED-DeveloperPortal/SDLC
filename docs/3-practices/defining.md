# Defining
*Clarifying purpose, priorities, and direction so everyone pulls in the same direction.*
* Turns research insights into actionable direction
* Helps teams focus on what matters most—outcomes, not just output
* Aligns stakeholders, delivery teams, and users around shared goals
* Supports meaningful prioritisation and lean delivery
* Prevents drift, ambiguity, and gold-plating


### Desired outcomes vs Anti-patterns
*Desired outcomes:*
* A clearly articulated problem or opportunity statement
* Shared understanding of user and business goals
* A prioritised backlog of actionable work
* Agreement on what “good” looks like (definition of done/success)
* Trade-offs and constraints are visible and agreed upon
  
*Anti-patterns:*
* Vague requirements or constantly shifting goals
* Too much upfront detail (overplanning or solutionising too early)
* Assumptions treated as facts
* Priorities shaped by loudest voice, not greatest value
* Defining done based on output (e.g., “code delivered”) not outcome


### When we do it
* After early discovery, once needs are emerging
* At the start of a new initiative, sprint, or roadmap cycle
* When backlog becomes bloated, scattered, or misaligned
* When team or stakeholder priorities conflict
* When delivery is happening but no one’s sure why


### Tools & Techniques
* Lean Canvas or Opportunity Canvas
* Problem statements and success criteria
* User story mapping
* MoSCoW or ICE prioritisation
* Product vision statements and roadmaps
* Epic breakdown and backlog refinement
* Value mapping and outcomes chains
* Definition of Done (DoD) and Definition of Ready (DoR)
* HCD alignment tools (e.g. value proposition canvas, JTBD)


### Practice in Action
**“Ahead of Sprint Planning, the team used a Lean Canvas to map what they’d learned in discovery. It helped them define their problem space, uncover assumptions, and refine their backlog. A bloated epic was split into three smaller, outcome-aligned stories—with one idea dropped entirely. The team left the session confident, aligned, and focused.”**
