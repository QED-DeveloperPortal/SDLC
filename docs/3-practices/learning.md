## Learning
*Making every release, risk, and result a chance to get better.*
* Turns delivery into discovery by **measuring what matters**
* Creates feedback loops between users, operations, support, and delivery
* Encourages safe experimentation and course correction
* Surfaces what’s working, what’s unclear, and what needs to change
* Makes improvement **a habit**, not a post-mortem


### Desired outcomes vs Anti-patterns
*Desired outcomes:*
* Product decisions informed by usage, not just assumptions
* Teams run retros, share learnings, and adapt regularly
* User feedback is gathered, visible, and acted on
* Hypotheses and experiments are tracked and reviewed
* Learning loops exist at team, product, and portfolio levels

*Anti-patterns:*
* “One and done” delivery with no iteration
* Lessons captured but never applied
* Feedback collected but siloed or ignored
* Metrics that track vanity or compliance, not value
* Blame culture or fear of exposing uncertainty


### When we do it
* After releases, retrospectives, or incidents
* When trusted user feedback loops highlight pain points or opportunities
* In response to unexpected behaviour surfaced through telemetry or monitoring
* During regular review rituals like roadmap updates or team retros
* While designing or planning—by reviewing prior experiments and usage pattern


### Tools & Techniques
* Sprint reviews and retrospectives
* Post-incident reviews (blameless and constructive)
* Product and usage analytics (e.g. GA, Mixpanel, Matomo)
* User feedback forms, surveys, and direct interviews
* Hypothesis tracking and experiment logs
* Heatmaps, session replay, and interaction metrics
* Feedback-driven backlog refinement
* Learning reviews across product portfolios or org-wide initiatives
* “You build it, you learn from it” accountability frameworks


### Practice in Action
**“The team launched a new dashboard feature with two layout variants behind a feature flag. They monitored usage, engagement, and support tickets, and found that one variant had better task completion—but more confusion on mobile. In the retro, they decided to combine the best elements of both, updated the design, and validated the change the following week.”**
