# Life cycle model management process

### Purpose
Ensures the availability and awareness of approved **life cycle policies, models, and procedures** for all development teams.  
This process promotes consistency across projects and alignment with organisational objectives and ISO 15288:2015.

### Outcomes
- Development teams are aware of, and apply, approved life cycle processes and procedures.  
- Roles, responsibilities, and authority within teams are clarified.  
- Improvements to SDLC models and methods are captured and maintained.  
- Each development team confirms the presence of its release within approved SDLC tracking tools.  

### Artefacts
| **Artefact** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Life Cycle Policy Register | Lists applicable SDLC and organisational policies. |
| SDLC Model Reference | Describes approved life cycle stages and workflows. |
| Process Improvement Log | Records enhancements to life cycle models and tools. |

### Notes
- May be **skipped** if team members are already inducted and tools are configured correctly.  
- Team leads must ensure all members understand the organisation’s policies and tool use.  
- Awareness of **open-source library use and licence obligations** should form part of team induction.  
- Aligned to **ISO 15288:2015 — Life Cycle Model Management Process**.  
- For modern environments, lifecycle awareness may be reinforced via **onboarding automation**, **repository templates**, or **policy-as-code** mechanisms.
