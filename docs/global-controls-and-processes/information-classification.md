# Information classification process

### Purpose
Identifies and classifies data handled by the system or release, establishing information-security requirements early in development.  
Supports creation of the **Information Security Assessment** and guides subsequent **Risk Assessment** activities.

### Outcomes
- High-level data entities and data types identified.  
- Classification applied to each entity or field based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- Data storage locations and access levels determined.  
- Protection requirements and legislative or policy constraints documented.  

### Artefacts
| **Artefact** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Information Security Assessment | Documents classification outcomes and rationale. |


### **Notes**
- Owned and performed by the **Information Management Authority** in accordance with departmental policy.  
- Conducted once per development activity; may be revisited for major design or data changes.  
- In iterative or Agile contexts, classification is reviewed during **Analysis & Design** to ensure new data remains appropriately protected.  
- Aligned to **ISO 15288:2015 — Decision Management Process**.  
- In modern cloud or CI/CD settings, this process may be embedded into **data modelling pipelines** or **metadata tagging** workflows.
