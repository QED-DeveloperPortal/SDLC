# Cloud assessment process

### Purpose
Determines the **suitability and feasibility** of using cloud services or hosting for a release, ensuring risks and decisions are documented, traceable, and compliant with organisational cloud policy.

### Outcomes
- Cloud service or hosting suitability determined and documented.  
- Rationale for cloud adoption or rejection recorded.  
- Traceability established for decision criteria and justification.  

### Artefacts
| **Artefact** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Cloud Assessment Report | Summarises outcomes and rationale of the assessment. |
| Cloud-Based Development Briefing Note | Prepared for senior executives, highlighting aspects of the proposed cloud implementation. |

### Notes
- Applies to releases adopting cloud services **for the first time** or altering existing cloud arrangements.  
- Owned and performed by the **Cloud Assessment Authority** under departmental procedures.  
- Aligned to **ISO 15288:2015 — Decision Management Process**.  
- For hybrid or multi-cloud contexts, integrate with **Cloud Governance Frameworks**, **Landing-Zone policies**, and **Container orchestration controls**.  
- Can be automated or templated in **DevOps pipelines** (e.g., pre-deployment cloud approval gates).
