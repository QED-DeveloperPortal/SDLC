The GitHub repository **QED-DeveloperPortal/SDLC** is a guide to the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** specifically created for the **Department of Education, Queensland**.

From the point of view of someone wanting to learn about the content, this repository serves as a **documentation portal** to understand the **official process and standards** for developing software within that specific government department.

Here is a summary of what you can expect to find in the repository:

***

## üìù Key Purpose
The core content is a **guide** detailing the **entire SDLC** as practiced by the Queensland Department of Education (QED). This is crucial for anyone involved in building applications for or with the department, as it outlines the mandatory steps, policies, and best practices from initial idea to deployment and maintenance.

## üìÇ Expected Content for a Learner
While the direct content of the files wasn't fully readable in the summary, the folder structure and description strongly suggest the documentation covers the following learning topics:

* **SDLC Phases and Documentation:** The `docs` folder is likely the main area, containing detailed documentation for each stage of the SDLC (e.g., Planning, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment).
* **Standards and Best Practices:** The guide will detail the **required quality, security, and governance standards** that must be met for software within QED.
* **Tools and Diagrams:** The `diagrams` folder suggests visual aids are included to help learners understand complex processes, architectures, or workflows.
* **Contributing and References:** The `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `references` folders indicate resources for community contribution to the documentation and links to external or internal department policies that underpin the SDLC.

## üí° Learning Takeaway
For a learner, this repository is the definitive source for understanding the **governance and procedural requirements** of software development within a specific, large-scale organization (QED). It's less about learning *how* to code, and more about learning *how to develop systems correctly* and **compliant with government standards**.
