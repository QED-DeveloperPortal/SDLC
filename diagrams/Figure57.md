Figure 57 - The work breakdown structure of the Implementation Process

Implementation Process Stages:

1. Prepare for implementation (establish presence in source control, establish development environment, etc...)
2. Gain access to enabling systems, if required
3. Realise or adapt system elements, according to the strategy, constraints, requirements and defined implementation procedures while treating issues
4. Develop or update unit tests, record implementation results and address any anomalies encountered
5. Find and treat issues
6. Generate test reports
7. IMPORTANT: For high-risk releases, ensure minimum code coverage for unit tests and automatied regression tests have been achieved
