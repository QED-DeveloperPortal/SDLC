Figure 81 - The work breakdown structure of the Support Process

Support Process Stages:

1. Create a new support request through support ticketing systems (eg Service Now or Team Foundation Serivce) and provide further details (eg how to replicate an issue, if applicable)
2. Analyse the reported request or problem and categorise the request in different dimensions like
  a) Type: for example, corrective, improvement, preventive, or adaptive to new environment
  b) Scope: for example, size of modification, cost involved, time to modify
  c) Criticality: for example, impact on performance, safety or security
3. Action the request for inclusion in next releases through the "Release Planning and Size Determination Process"
