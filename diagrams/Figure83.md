Figure 83 - The work breakdown structure of the Disposal Process

Disposal Process Stages:

1. Identify system constraints from disposal on the system requirements, architecture and design characteristics, or implementation techniques
2. Identify and plan for the necessary related systems or services or Firewall rules or service accounts or EIP interfaces in and out of the system-to-be-disposed-of to support disposal. Backup and migrate data, if required
3. Define preventive methods to preclude disposed elements and materials that should not be repurposed, reclaimed or reused.
4. Deactivate the system or system element to prepare it for removal
5. Remove the system, system element, or waste material from use or production for appropriate disposition and action
6. Conduct destruction or disposal of the system properly
7. Finalise the disposal and compile the disposal report
8. IMPORTANT: Systems involving protected or highly-protected data: Ensure destruction or disposal of the hardware is carried out properly and in an unrecoverable manner
