2. Identifying the support/change requests or features to be included in the releases being planned
3. Recording build planning decisions
4. Establish a work breakdown structure based on the evolving system architecture
5. Define and maintain a project schedule based on management and technical objectives and work estimates
6. Define the costs and plan a budget
7. Define roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities
8. Define the infrastructure and services required
9. Plan the acquisition of materials and enabling system services supplied from outside the project
10. Obtain authorisation for the development of the release

12. Determine if this is the first-ever release of a non-existing system
13. Determine if the release changes business processes involving external agencies for the first time
14. Perform size estimation
15. Determine if the required effort-hours needed for the release exceed the minimum Type 1 release threshold
16. Determine if the release covers any new requirements or cover changes made to any existing requirements
