3. Update artefact history and versions and/or reflect changes in applicable requirements management tools
4. Identify affected stakeholders
5. Engage with applicable business owner, representatives and stakeholders
6. Define each function that the system is required to perform
7. Perform system-specific security requirements gathering
8. Define necessary implementation constraints
9. Identify system requirements that relate to risks, criticality of the system, or critical quality characteristics
10. Define system requirements and rationale
11. Analyse the requirements and define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement
12. For low-risk releases, perform stakeholders review and seek approvals from affected stakeholders locally
13. IMPORTANT: For high-risk releases, perform stakeholder reviews and seek approvals from ALL stakeholders, including external ones. Seek approval at Executive Level
