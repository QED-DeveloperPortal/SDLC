Figure 49 - Work breakdown structure for the Iteration Planning Process

Iteration Planning Process

Steps:

1. Identify the iteration objectives and constraints
2. Define the iteration scope
3. Establish a work breakdown structure based on the evolving system architecture
4. Define and maintain a iteration schedule based on management and technical objectives and work estimates
5. Define achievement criteria for the life cycle stage decision gates, delivery dates and major dependencies on external inputs or outputs
6. Define roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities, if needed
7. Plan the acquisition of materials and enabling system services supplied from outside the iteration
8. Obtain authorisation for the iteration
9. Implement iteration plans
