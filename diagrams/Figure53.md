Figure 53 - Work breakdown structure for the Physical Design Definition Process

Physical Design Definition Process Stages:

1. Determine if there are any changes in the physical architecture
2. Prepare for architecture definition (create artefact or establish presence in architecture repository management tools)
3. Update artefact history and versions and/or reflect changes in applicable architecture repository management tools
4. Identify affected parts of the architecture
5. Define evaluation criteria based on stakeholder concerns and key requirements
6. Develop architecture viewpoints
7. Develop models and view of candidate architectures
8. Assess architecture candidates
9. Determine the preferred alternative
10. Update the artefacts with the results
