Figure 11 - The work breakdown structure of the Risk Determination Process

Risk Assessment Process Stages:

1. For each risk aspect (category) in "Risk consequence levels":
  a) Determine the applicable consequence level associated with the release.
  b) Use "Risk likelihood levels" to determine the applicable likelihood level of the risk aspect for the release.
  c) Use "Release Risk Impact Levels matrix" for the risk aspect (category) to determine the risk impact level of the risk aspect for this release.
2. Finally, find the "highest" assessed risk impact level for the release in all risk aspects which is considered as the overall release risk impact level
