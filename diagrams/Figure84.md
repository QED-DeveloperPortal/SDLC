Figure 84 - The workflow of the Disposal Process

Steps:

1. Identify system constraints from disposal on the system requirements, architecture and design characteristics, or implementation techniques
2.  Identify and plan for the necessary related systems or services or Firewall rules or service accounts or EIP interfaces in and out of the system-to-be-disposed-of to support disposal. Backup and migrate data, if required.
3. Define preventive methods to preclude disposed elements and materials that should not be repurposed, reclaimed or reused
4. Deactivate the system or system element to prepare it for removal
5. Remove the system, system element or waste material from use or production for appropriate disposition and action
6. Conduct destruction or disposal of the system properly
7. If system involves protected or highly protected data then (IMPORTANT!) ensure destruction or disposal of the hardware is carried out properly and in an unrecoverable manner
8. Finalise disposal and compile the disposal report
